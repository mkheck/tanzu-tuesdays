Mr. Gray is a Principal Technologist at VMWare with over 20 years of experience in software development, software architecture. He is co-author of Apress’s Pro Spring Integration. He’s helped organizations large and small build service-based architectures in a number of different runtimes and platforms over the decades, but adopting Spring in 2004, and using it whenever possible since, was a no-brainer that culminated in joining the Spring team in 2017. As a Spring Developer Advocate, Mario loves to engage and inspire developers and businesses in the Pivotal ecosystem.
